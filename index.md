# PICO-8 games

## 1st Game: Half Pipe
My first attempt at a PICO-8 game. The game gets faster as you keep playing. You just need to press the correct button combo. You can press and hold the direction, and then push the X or O button. By default, the X button is "X" on the keyboard, and the O button is "Z" on the keyboard.
