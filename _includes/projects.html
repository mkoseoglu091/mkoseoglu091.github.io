                <p style="float:right">A reaction game I developed in the course of a weekend, in order to learn PICO-8. You simply have to press the correct button combinations. You can press and hold the direction before pressing the action key. (X -> "X" key on the keyboard. O -> "Z key on the keyboard) (PS: Music: CKY - 96 Quite Bitter Beings)</p>
