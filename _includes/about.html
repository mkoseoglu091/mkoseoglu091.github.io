            <p class="paragraph-text justify-text">
                I completed my bachelor's at the University of Melbourne, majoring in Computer Science. I am very interested in Game Development, Tools Development, Technical Art and Artificial Intelligence. As an older graduate, I have found my passion in Computer Science but I have varying levels of experience in different fields ranging from Graphic Design to Biology. I believe these experiences shaped how I look at problems and find appropriate and innovative solutions.

                I enjoy working with a team as well as working individually. I believe one of my strongest qualities is my communication skills. As a very curious person, I enjoy learning new things more than anything else, and I am adaptable. The programming languages that I am most familiar with are Python, C#, C++, Java, C and Javascript among others.

                I am currently doing a post-bachelor diploma in Computer and Information Systems (Emerging Technologies) at Douglas College, Vancouver, Canada. I also try to find the time to make my own small games (Some of which can be found below!). I am also in the process of learning Maya and Houdini, along with other similar software, in order to find a job as a Technical Artist or a Pipeline TD.
